## A couple of matlab workshops for PSB SystemBio course

These are Hi-C related workshops given within the frames of PSB Systems Biology course, using proprietary Matlab compautational system.

Two workshops were given in 2019:
 - (1) is based on a pre-processed Hi-C data, aka "pairs",
 - (2) and another one for binned data, aka contact frequency maps, aka heatmaps.

The heatmap-based workshop also contains materials (slides, code etc) that were used by Hakan Ozadam to teach this workshop in 2017/2018.
