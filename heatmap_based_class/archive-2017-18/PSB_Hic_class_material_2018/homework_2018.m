%In this homework, you'll be doing a simplified 
%version of the work we did in class for another contact map
%Use the functions provided according to your needs.
%The steps are outlined below.

%Read the data into a matrix
%This data is in the file homework.tsv

%flip the matrix

%Draw a heatmap using the flipped 'hot' colormap
%Include this heatmap in your files.
%Hint: Remember the scaling for the heatmap

%get the distance decay data from the raw_matrix using the getScalingPlotData function

%plot the distance decay data.
%Hint: both axis are on log scale


% Send this script, the heatmap and the distance decay plots, you generated, to Hakan Ozadam
