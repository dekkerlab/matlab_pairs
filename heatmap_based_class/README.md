## Hi-C heatmap-based workshop for PSB MatLab course

This is a continuation of the previous workshop that we did using pair-type of information extracted from Hi-C experiments.

This one is mostly concerned with extracting "compartment"-level information from Hi-C heatmaps.

### todo:
 - dig through available scritps:
      - keep essential
      - throw out BS
      - add illustrative examples that improve understanding
      - "estimate" what could be done during 1.5 hours ...
      - homework ?
      - add a transition from a previous pairs-based workshop ...

### MatLab is "open"
